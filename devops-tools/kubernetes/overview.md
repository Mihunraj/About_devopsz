# Kubernetes Overview

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a framework for running distributed systems resiliently.

### Key Features of Kubernetes

- **Automated Deployment**: Automatically deploys and manages containerized applications.
- **Scaling**: Easily scale applications up or down based on demand.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes network traffic to ensure stability and performance.

## Key Concepts

- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.
- **Node**: A worker machine in Kubernetes, which can be a physical or virtual machine.
- **Cluster**: A set of nodes that run containerized applications.
- **Service**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them.
