# Jenkins Overview

## What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software. It supports continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, allowing teams to automate the software development process.

### Key Features of Jenkins

- **Extensible**: Jenkins has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality.
- **Distributed Builds**: Jenkins can distribute build tasks across multiple machines.
- **Pipeline as Code**: Jenkins allows you to define your build and deployment processes using code.

## Key Concepts

- **Job**: A single task or a series of tasks that Jenkins performs (e.g., building a project).
- **Pipeline**: A set of automated processes that define the stages of a software delivery workflow.
- **Node**: A machine that Jenkins uses to execute jobs.
