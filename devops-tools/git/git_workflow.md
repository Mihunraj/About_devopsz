# Git Overview

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development, enabling collaboration, versioning, and history management.

### Key Features of Git

- **Distributed Version Control**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history, allowing for offline work and better collaboration.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows users to create branches for new features or fixes, which can later be merged back into the main codebase.
- **Staging Area**: Git uses a staging area to prepare changes before committing them to the repository.
- **History Tracking**: Git maintains a history of changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions of the code.

### Basic Concepts

- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory that contains your project files and the history of changes made to those files.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to the files in the repository. Each commit has a unique ID.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development in a repository. The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`.
- **Merge**: The process of combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Remote**: A version of your repository that is hosted on the internet or another network.

## Why Use Git?

- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
- **Backup**: Since every developer has a full copy of the repository, it serves as a backup.
- **Version Control**: Easily track and revert changes, making it simple to manage different versions of a project.
