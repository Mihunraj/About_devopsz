# Docker Overview

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers package an application and its dependencies into a single unit, ensuring that it runs consistently across different environments.

### Key Features of Docker

- **Lightweight**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines.
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own environment, ensuring that applications do not interfere with each other.

## Key Concepts

- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
- **Containers**: Running instances of Docker images.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.
